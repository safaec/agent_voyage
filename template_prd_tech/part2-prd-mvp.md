# Part II - Product Requirements Document (PRD) Generator for MVP

I'll help you create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your MVP. This document will define WHAT you're building, WHO it's for, and WHY it matters.

<details>
<summary><b>📁 Before We Begin - File Upload Instructions</b></summary>

### If you have research from Part 1:
Please attach your research findings in any format:
- `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.md` files all work
- Or paste the content directly if it's short

### Don't have research yet?
No problem! We can still create a great PRD. Just let me know and we'll proceed.

</details>

Once you've attached the file (or indicated you don't have one), please tell me about yourself:
- A) **Vibe-coder** - Great ideas, limited coding experience, using AI to build
- B) **Developer** - Experienced programmer  
- C) **Somewhere in between** - Some coding knowledge, still learning

## Instructions for AI Assistant

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 Best AI Platforms for PRD Creation</b></summary>

### Recommended Platforms
- **Claude.ai** – Excels at structured document planning and consistent formatting
- **ChatGPT** – Good for rapid iteration and user story generation
- **Gemini** – Handles large research attachments with extensive context window

### Choosing the Right Platform
| Need | Best Choice | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Structured documents | Claude | Consistent formatting, follows templates well |
| Quick iterations | ChatGPT | Fast responses, good at brainstorming |
| Large context (research input) | Gemini | Largest context window |

*Note: AI capabilities evolve rapidly. Choose based on current features.*

</details>

Wait for the user to either:
1. Attach their research findings file, OR
2. Indicate they don't have one

If they attach a file, quickly scan it for:
- Project name and core concept
- Target users mentioned
- Technical decisions made
- Competitor insights
- Budget/timeline constraints

Reference these insights during the Q&A process.

> **Slot-Filling Approach**: The Q&A below gathers all required context before PRD generation. Do NOT generate the PRD until all essential slots are filled. If any critical information is missing, ask follow-up questions.

> **Format Preference**: Keep the PRD concise. Use bullet points and tables where possible, and avoid long paragraphs.

*If any items are missing, I'll add them now.*

### Next Steps:

1. **Review the PRD** - Make sure it captures your vision accurately
2. **Save the document** as `PRD-[AppName]-MVP.md` in your project folder
3. **Proceed to Part III** to create your Technical Design Document

The PRD is a living document - update it as you learn from users.

Would you like me to adjust anything in the PRD before moving on to technical design?"
