CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),

```

## Feature Implementation

### Feature 1: [From PRD]

#### API Design
```typescript
// Endpoint definitions
POST   /api/[feature]          // Create
GET    /api/[feature]          // List
GET    /api/[feature]/:id      // Get one
PUT    /api/[feature]/:id      // Update
DELETE /api/[feature]/:id      // Delete

// Request/Response types
interface Create[Feature]Request {
  [fields from PRD]
}

interface [Feature]Response {
  id: string;
  [fields];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Business Logic
```typescript
class [Feature]Service {
  async create(data: Create[Feature]DTO): Promise<[Feature]> {
    // Validation
    // Business rules
    // Persistence
    // Event emission
  }
  
  async findAll(filters: FilterDTO): Promise<[Feature][]> {
    // Query building
    // Pagination
    // Caching strategy
  }
}
```

[Repeat for each PRD feature]

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
interface AuthStrategy {
  provider: 'local' | 'oauth';
  tokenExpiry: '1h';
  refreshExpiry: '7d';
  mfa: boolean;
}

// RBAC implementation
enum Role {
  USER = 'user',
  ADMIN = 'admin'
}

// Middleware
authenticate() -> validates JWT
authorize(role) -> checks permissions
rateLimiter() -> prevents abuse
```

### Security Headers
```javascript
// Helmet.js configuration
{
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Browser Cache:** Static assets (1 year)
- **CDN Cache:** Images/media (CloudFront/Cloudflare)
- **Application Cache:** Redis for sessions/hot data
- **Database Cache:** Query result caching

### Optimization Techniques
```javascript
// Code splitting (Next.js)
const Feature = dynamic(() => import('./Feature'), {
  loading: () => <Skeleton />,
  ssr: false
});

// Database query optimization
// Use indexes, limit projections, paginate
const results = await db.query({
  select: ['id', 'name'], // Only needed fields
  where: { indexed_field: value },
  limit: 20,
  offset: page * 20
});
```

- Use git hooks or a hook manager appropriate for your stack
- Update hooks as the project scales

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
      
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci --production
      - uses: [deploy-action]
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Targets
- Unit Tests: 80% coverage
- Integration Tests: Critical paths
- E2E Tests: Main user journeys

### Testing Stack
```javascript
// Unit testing
describe('FeatureService', () => {
  it('should create feature', async () => {
    const result = await service.create(mockData);
    expect(result).toMatchObject(expected);
  });
});

// E2E testing (Playwright)
test('user can complete main flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.click('[data-testid=start]');
  // ... test steps
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/success');
});
```

### Visual Verification Loop
UI changes should use a Generate-Render-Inspect-Refine cycle:
1. **Generate:** AI produces component code
2. **Render:** Preview in dev server or headless browser
3. **Inspect:** Screenshot capture + design principle check
4. **Refine:** Fix visual regressions before committing

### Self-Healing Test Pattern
When Playwright tests fail, capture context for auto-repair:
```javascript
// Capture failure context for AI repair
const failureContext = {
  error: error.message,
  codeSnippet: testCode,
  ariaSnapshot: await page.accessibility.snapshot()
};
// AI prompt: "Fix selector using getByRole or getByText"
```

## Deployment

### Infrastructure as Code
```terraform
# main.tf
resource "aws_ecs_service" "app" {
  name            = var.app_name
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.main.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.app.arn
  desired_count   = var.app_count
  
  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_alb_target_group.app.arn
    container_name   = var.app_name
    container_port   = var.app_port
  }
}
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env.production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
JWT_SECRET=...
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
SENTRY_DSN=...
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
- **Application:** Response time, error rate, throughput
- **Business:** User signups, feature adoption, retention
- **Infrastructure:** CPU, memory, disk, network

### Logging Strategy
```typescript
// Structured logging with Pino
logger.info({
  event: 'user_action',
  userId: user.id,
  action: 'feature_used',
  metadata: { feature: 'name', duration: 123 }
});
```

## AI Prompting Guide

### Effective Prompts for Your Level

#### For New Features
```
I need to add [feature] to my Next.js app.
Current setup: Supabase for backend, Tailwind for styling.
Requirements:
- [Requirement 1 from PRD]
- [Requirement 2 from PRD]
Please explain the approach first, then provide code.
```

#### For Debugging
```
I'm getting this error: [error message]
Context: Trying to [what you're doing]
Current code: [paste relevant code]
Stack: Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind
Please explain what's wrong and how to fix it.
```

#### For Learning
```
I implemented [feature] with this code: [paste code]
It works, but can you explain:
1. How does [specific part] work?
2. Is this the best approach?
3. What should I learn next?
```

## Simplified Architecture

### How Your App Works

```
User clicks button → Frontend sends request → Backend processes → Database saves → Frontend updates

Specifically:
1. User Action (React component)
2. API Call (fetch or Supabase client)
3. Backend Logic (Supabase functions)
4. Database Operation (PostgreSQL)
5. Response (JSON data)
6. UI Update (React re-render)
```

### Key Concepts to Understand

1. **Components:** Reusable pieces of UI
   - Think: LEGO blocks for interfaces
   
2. **State:** Data that changes
   - Think: Variables that update the screen
   
3. **Props:** Data passed to components
   - Think: Settings for your LEGO blocks
   
4. **Hooks:** React features
   - Think: Special functions starting with 'use'
